# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm KooJunHui

ðŸ“Œ About Me  

I am a senior student majoring in Computer Science at Incheon National University and a **backend developer specialized in Java/Spring**.  

With hands-on experience from planning to server performance testing and monitoring (K6, Grafana), I am confident in delivering **stable service operations and handling high traffic**.  

I have built **AI-driven services** using LangChain, RAG, and LangGraph, and thanks to extensive project experience, I can maintain a **fast development pace** even with lower-productivity languages like Java/Spring. 

I also developed **real-time chat and notification systems** using Spring WebSocket, FCM, and Redpanda, proving my capability in building diverse real-time services.
